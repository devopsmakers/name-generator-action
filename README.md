# pr-name-generator-action
A Github action to create consistent and unique names for PR based environments.

Uses [unique-names-generator](https://github.com/andreasonny83/unique-names-generator)
and a "seed" based on the repo owner, name and issue (PR) number to generate a
unique and consistent name. This makes it easy to deploy and clean up ephemaral
environments on PR open, close or merge without needing to keep track of a 
non-deterministic unique name.

## Inputs
None.

## Outputs
### `name`
The generated unique and consistent name
